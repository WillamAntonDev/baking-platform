  <p>
    I am a professional baker with over 20 years of experience, dedicated to sharing my passion for baking with others.
    My journey began in bustling kitchens under the guidance of exceptional pastry chefs in St. Petersburg, Florida,
    Chicago, and Nashville, who instilled in me the values of patience, dedication, and creativity.

    Now, I'm excited to bring my expertise to a new audience through my social media platforms, including Instagram,
    Facebook, and Threads. My mission is to make baking approachable, fun, and rewarding for everyone, whether you're
    creating your first loaf of bread or dreaming of opening your own bakery.
